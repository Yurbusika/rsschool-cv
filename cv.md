## About me:

My name is Myra and I'm 25. For a year I've been learning programming on my own from scratch. During this year, I learned to think differently than I was used to. And acquired the hard skills necessary for development in this area.

My musical background has taught me perseverance and patience. And in the present it has become a source of inspiration.

Web development attracts me because of its large and diverse, open community. The prospects of the profession and the uniqueness of the industry.
